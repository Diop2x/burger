# Node Express Handlebars

This app you to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars. Make sure you try out the House special :). The DioplaFlame Burger. 

## How It Works
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the
 left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user
 clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* It will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
